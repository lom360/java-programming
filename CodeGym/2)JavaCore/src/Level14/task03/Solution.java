/* 
Building and School
1. Create the correct inheritance relationship between Building and School.
2. Think about which type of object the getSchool and getBuilding methods should return.
3. Change null to a Building or School object.

P.S. Don't change the signatures of the getSchool and getBuilding methods.

Requirements:
1. The School class should inherit the Building class.
2. The getSchool method must return a new School.
3. The getBuilding method must return a new Building.
4. The School class must be static.
5. The Building class must be static.
