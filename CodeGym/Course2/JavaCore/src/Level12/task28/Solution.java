/* 
Interfaces for the Human class
Add as many interfaces to the Human class as possible, but be sure that it doesn't become an abstract class.
You can't add methods to the Human class.

Requirements:
1. The Solution class must have an Employee interface with a void workLazily() method.
2. The Solution class must have a Businessman interface with a void workHard() method.
3. The Solution class must have a Secretary interface with a void workLazily() method.
4. The Solution class must have a Miner interface with a void workVeryHard() method.
5. The Solution class must have a Human class with the methods: void workHard() and void workLazily().
6. The Human class must implement three interfaces.
