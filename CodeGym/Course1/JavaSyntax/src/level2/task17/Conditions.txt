Write a function that computes the minimum of four numbers.
The function min(a, b, c, d) should use (call) the function min(a, b)

Hint:
You need to write the body of the two existing min functions.

Requirements:
•	The program should display text on the screen.
•	The min methods should not display text on the screen.
•	The main method should call min(a, b) and min(a, b, c, d).
•	The main method should display the result of the min methods. Each time, on a new line.
•	The min(a, b) method must return the minimum of the numbers a and b.
•	The min(a, b, c, d) method must use the min(a, b) method.
•	The min(a, b, c, d) method must return the minimum of the numbers a, b, c, and d.
