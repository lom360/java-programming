/* 
Janitorial services
1. Implement the cleanAllApartments method.
For each object in apartments:
2. For one-bedroom apartments (OneRoomApt), call the clean1Room method.
i.e. if an OneRoomApt object is passed, then call its clean1Room method.
3. For two-bedroom apartments (TwoRoomApt), call the clean2Rooms method
i.e. if an TwoRoomApt object is passed, then call its clean2Rooms method.
4. For three-bedroom apartments (ThreeRoomApt), call the clean3Rooms method
i.e. if an ThreeRoomApt object is passed, then call its clean3Rooms method.

Requirements:
1. The cleanAllApartments method must take a list of apartments as an argument.
2. For all one-bedroom apartments (OneRoomApt) in the list, the cleanAllApartments method must call the clean1Room method.
3. For all two-bedroom apartments (TwoRoomApt) in the list, the cleanAllApartments method must call the clean2Rooms method.
4. For all three-bedroom apartments (ThreeRoomApt) in the list, the cleanAllApartments method must call the clean3Rooms method.
5. The OneRoomApt, TwoRoomApt, and ThreeRoomApt classes should support (implement) the Apartment interface.
